# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
-what is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability and allows developers to use fewer lines of code to express concepts compared to other programming languages like C++ or Java. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
**Key features**
-Easy to learn
-Dynamically typed
-Interpreted language
**Use cases**
-Web development
-Data science and machine learning
-Automation and scripting
2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
   - Linux

    -Install Python via Package Manager:
        Open Terminal.
        For Debian-based distributions (like Ubuntu), run:

        sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

For Red Hat-based distributions (like Fedora), run:

sh

    sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip

-Verify Installation:

    Type python3 --version and press Enter. You should see the Python version number displayed.

-Set Up a Virtual Environment:

    Install virtualenv using pip.

    sh

pip3 install virtualenv

-Create a virtual environment.

sh

python3 -m venv myenv

-Activate the virtual environment.

sh

source myenv/bin/activate

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
Simple Python Program

Here's a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

python

-print("Hello, World!")

-Explanation of Basic Syntax Elements

    print() Function:
        The print() function is a built-in Python function used to output text to the console.
        Syntax: print(expression)
        In this case, the expression is "Hello, World!".

    Strings:
        A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. In Python, you can use single (') or double (") quotes to define a string.
        Example: "Hello, World!" is a string literal.

    Parentheses:
        The parentheses () are used to enclose the arguments of a function. In this case, the print() function takes a single argument, the string "Hello, World!".

-Detailed Breakdown

    print: This is the name of the built-in function.
    ("Hello, World!"): The parentheses indicate that print is a function call, and "Hello, World!" is the argument passed to this function
    
4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
   - Basic Data Types in Python

   - Integer (int):
        Represents whole numbers without a fractional part.
        Example: 42, -7.

   - Float (float):
        Represents numbers with a fractional part (decimal point).
        Example: 3.14, -0.001.

   - String (str):
        Represents a sequence of characters.
        Example: "Hello, World!", 'Python is fun!'.

   - Boolean (bool):
        Represents one of two values: True or False.
        Example: True, False.

    -List (list):
        Represents an ordered collection of items (can be of different types).
        Example: [1, 2, 3], ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'].

   - Tuple (tuple):
        Represents an ordered collection of items (immutable).
        Example: (1, 2, 3), ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry').

  -  Dictionary (dict):
        Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
        Example: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}, {1: 'one', 2: 'two'}.
     
   - Set (set):
        Represents an unordered collection of unique items.
        Example: {1, 2, 3}, {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}.

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   - Conditional Statements in Python
Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. The most common conditional statements are if, elif (else if), and else.
Example: if-else Statement

-python

# Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero
num = 10

if num > 0:
    print("Number is positive")
elif num < 0:
    print("Number is negative")
else:
    print("Number is zero")
-Loops in Python
Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true (while loop) or for a specified number of times (for loop).
Example: for Loop

python

# Iterate over a list of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

-In this example:

    The for loop iterates over each element (fruit) in the list fruits.
    During each iteration, the current element (fruit) is printed.
    The loop continues until all elements in the list have been processed.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

-Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, making it more modular, readable, and easier to maintain. Functions accept inputs (arguments), perform operations, and optionally return an output.
Example: Python Function to Calculate Sum

python

def calculate_sum(a, b):
    """
    Function to calculate the sum of two numbers.

    Parameters:
        a (int, float): First number.
        b (int, float): Second number.

    Returns:
        int, float: Sum of the two numbers.
    """
    return a + b

   - 

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
Differences Between Lists and Dictionaries in Python

  -  Lists:
        Ordered collection of items.
        Accessed by index (position) starting from 0.
        Elements can be of different data types.
        Mutable: Elements can be added, removed, or modified.
        Use square brackets [] to define and access elements.
    -Dictionaries:
        Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
        Accessed by key (unique identifier).
        Keys must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
        Values can be of any data type.
        Mutable: Elements can be added, removed, or modified.
        Use curly braces {} to define and access elements, with each key-value pair separated by a colon :.
     # Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a dictionary with key-value pairs
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "grade": "A"
}

# Print the list and dictionary
print("List of Numbers:", numbers)
print("Dictionary:", student)

# Accessing elements
print("\nAccessing Elements:")
print("First number in the list:", numbers[0])
print("Age of the student:", student["age"])

# Modifying elements
print("\nModifying Elements:")
numbers[0] = 10
student["grade"] = "B"
print("Updated list of numbers:", numbers)
print("Updated dictionary:", student)

# Adding elements
print("\nAdding Elements:")
numbers.append(6)
student["city"] = "New York"
print("List after adding a number:", numbers)
print("Dictionary after adding a new key-value pair:", student)

# Removing elements
print("\nRemoving Elements:")
numbers.remove(4)
del student["age"]
print("List after removing a number:", numbers)
print("Dictionary after removing a key-value pair:", student)

     
8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   - Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to deal with runtime errors or exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of a program. It allows you to gracefully handle errors and prevent your program from crashing.
Example: Using try, except, and finally Blocks
# Example function that divides two numbers
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b  # Attempt division
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero!")  # Handle division by zero error
        result = None  # Assign None as the result
    finally:
        print("Division operation completed!")  # Finally block always executes

    return result
                       
9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   - Modules: Modules are Python files containing Python code. They are used to organize code into reusable units. A module can define functions, classes, and variables that can be imported and used in other Python scripts.
-Packages: Packages are directories containing multiple Python modules. They help organize related modules into a hierarchical structure. A package must contain a special file called __init__.py to be recognized as a package.
# Import the math module
import math

# Calculate the square root of a number
number = 16
square_root = math.sqrt(number)

# Print the result
print("Square root of", number, "is", square_root)

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
Reading from a File

-To read from a file in Python, you can use the open() function to open the file in read mode ('r'). You can then use methods like read(), readline(), or readlines() to read the contents of the file.
python
# Open the file in read mode
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    # Read the entire content of the file
    content = file.read()

# Print the content to the console
print(content)
Writing to a File

-To write to a file in Python, you can use the open() function to open the file in write mode ('w'). You can then use methods like write() to write data to the file.

python

# List of strings to write to the file
lines = ["Line 1\n", "Line 2\n", "Line 3\n"]

# Open the file in write mode
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    # Write each string in the list to the file
    file.writelines(lines)

# Submission Guidelines:
